- create a python script to merge all the batch scans into one file and delete their individual files
- then use mc_ip_checker to verify the that server exists, then add it to a json file that will
contain all the online servers
- in a separate, iterate through all online servers and a player count is > 0 and is not already inside the json file, 
then append it. If the server is in the list and has no online players, remove it from the list
